I LOVE software! I mean, I really love it! For me, software is the art of the possible. It allows us to do things we could not even dream a generation ago. And applied in the right ways to the right tasks, software is the agent in the world that can make the difference. 

I rolled into software by accident 14 years ago. Working at a small educational consultancy I became embroiled in a highly inefficient report production process. My mind instinctively rails against poorly designed processes and I set about making improvements, first with Excel, then Access and then working with developers.  

Since 2002 I've worked in a number of small companies with many highly talented developers on some really interesting projects. I've been involved in project management, business analysis, testing, support. And I've worked alongside colleagues to create fantastic solutions that have made a difference to people's lives. 

Regarding coding, I've always looked on from the outside. I have excelled at providing developers with functional requirements that lead to great end products. But there was a line I did not cross when it came to coding.

I joined Makers Academy because I want to actually build the software. My aim is to use my new skills to work with a team to create something technically outstanding and functionally beautiful that will, in some small way, make the world a better place. 


## Skills

#### Communication

I'm a strong communicator. Over the years I've worked led focus groups, done presentations to executives, run workshops, organised sprint teams, run support seminars. I've worked with employees and clients at all levels of business. I have a particular talent for understanding technical issues and formulating technical solutions and then communicating these to non-technical managers or clients in a way that they can buy into. 

Whilst at Makers Academy I have maintained a [blog](https://simon-at-makers.ghost.io/ghost/2/) about learning to code. (ADD ADDITIONAL COURSE COMMUNICATION THINGS HERE)

#### Analysis

My years as a Business Analyst have proved brilliant preparation for life as a developer. I am able to turn vague ideas into actionable user stories, and enjoy using these to guide my development process.

I pick up new concepts with ease, and focus on asking the right questions to further my understanding of new ideas. 

#### Delivery

I have led several technology projects, and am highly experienced in prioritising work, identifying the best approach to reach minimum viable product and iterative delivery. I'm a certified scrum master and product owner and have worked in well fucntioning scrum teams. (I'm a big fan of scrum.)
