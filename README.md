I LOVE software! 

For me, software is the art of the possible. It allows us to do things we could not even dream a generation ago. And applied in the right ways to the right tasks, software is the agent in the world that can make the difference.

14 years ago, I accidentally rolled into software. Working at a small educational consultancy I worked with a highly inefficient report production process. My mind instinctively rails against poor process design and I set about making improvements, first with Excel, then Access and then working on a coded solution with developers.

Since 2002 I’ve worked in several small companies with talented developers on interesting projects. I’ve been involved in project management, business analysis, testing, support. And I’ve worked alongside colleagues to create fantastic solutions that have made a difference to people’s lives.

Regarding coding, I’ve always looked on from the outside. I have consistently provided developers with functional plans that led to great end products. But there was a line I did not cross when it came to coding.

I joined Makers Academy because I want to make the software. This course has reaffirmed my interest in development. I love the challenge, the constant learning, the team work and the sense of achievement. 

My aim is to use my new skills to work with a team to create something technically outstanding and functionally beautiful that will, in some small way, make the world a better place.



## Skills

#### Communication

I’m a strong communicator. In previous roles I’ve worked led focus groups, done presentations to executives, run workshops, organised sprint teams, run support seminars. I’ve worked with employees and clients at all levels of business. I have a talent for understanding technical issues and formulating technical solutions and then communicating these to non-technical managers or clients in a way that they can buy into.

During the course, I enjoyed leading team retrospectives to help the team reflect and learn from our sprints. 

Here is a blog I wrote about my time at Maker’s Academy https://simon-at-makers.ghost.io/


#### Analysis

In previous roles I have worked as a business analyst. This is good preparation for life as a developer. I can turn vague ideas into actionable user stories, and enjoy using these to guide my development process. I’m good at discussing projects clients and understanding their real challenges, beyond what they describe.

#### Team work

I am a good team player. Leaders like having me in their teams because I am positive, supportive and get results. Teams like to be led by me because I am clear thinking, a good planner and fair. 

#### Community

Maker’s Academy emphasizes the importance of community. To support the Maker’s community, I organised regular hardware meet ups for enthusiasts to get together and build prototypes. We’ve had a series of well attended and entertaining workshops.

## Experience

**Alkemygold Ltd - educational consultancy** (November 2013 to September 2016)    
*Project manager*  

Alkemygold is the market leader in A level performance reports for schools. For this project I designed, tested and piloted a new suite of reports for GCSE. 

Technically, this involved data modelling, report design, Excel prototyping, and writing up detailed specifications for the software team. 

On the business management side, I answered to the CEO and was responsible for client management, organising focus groups, liaising with educational consultants, manning stands at promotional events, organising the testing team and working with the software team to agree specifications for the project.
 

**Condaal Ltd** (January 2012 to November 2013)   
*Business owner*  

Ran a software accelerator competition looking for companies to partner on software projects.
Delivered a care home management system for a client.


**Alkemygold Ltd - educational consultancy** (June 2003 to December 2011)    
*Deputy CEO*   

In 2003 I joined my father in his new educational consultancy business that he started in 2001.
At first it was just the two of us. Today the business has grown to 35 employees and a turnover of £3m.

Over the years I had a wide range of roles and responsibilities. The largest of these was software and product development which has been an important factor in the continued growth of the company. This is where I grew to love software development and project management.

## Further interests

####Social justice
I am the secretary of my local SVP charity, providing practical support to the community such as visiting the elderly, sick and housebound. This is a grass roots way to support my local community. 

I have read several books focussed on social justice including The Spirit Level, Pathologies of Power, Capital in the 21st Century, The Idea of Justice.

####Hardware
At Makers Academy I set up a Hardware Meetup group to meet every couple of weeks. I’m keen to learn about hardware and this was a great way to start. I have prototypes some simple projects. 

####Reading
I enjoy reading non-fiction literature that gives a long view of human existence and tries to make some sense of this (Homo Sapiens, Guns, Germs and Steel, Collapse, Capital in the 21 Century, Homo Deus) and books that investigate the current human social, political and psychological condition (The Spirit Level, Pathologies of Power, Thinking, Fast and Slow). I also like science fiction and fantasy.

####Exercise
I enjoy cycling, running, Pilates and walking the dog with my wife.
